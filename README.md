# MCCLOSKEY---T-3---Using-Iterative-Statements
//Border Provisioners is located in Saskatchewan, Canada very near a U.S. border crossing into Montana.  In non-Covid times, there is significant border traffic and Border Provisioners gets a mix of both Canadian and U.S. citizen customers.  There's always some confusion from U.S. shoppers since prices are shown in Canadian dollars but customers are allowed to pay in U.S. currency if they wish.  As a convenience for the customers, the Manager would like to provide a conversion table that compares Canadian $ (CAD) to US$.  Write a program that uses an Iterative statement (While, For, or Do While - Just choose 1) to compute/print a table of values for the Manager. 

The "table" should always start at 0 CAD and never exceed 200 CAD.   To provide flexibility, ask the user to enter a CAD increment value, an integer value between 5 and 25 that will be used to increment CAD shown in each row.  For example, if the user enters a 10, then then first row will be 0 CAD (starting value), the 2nd row will show 10 CAD, the 3rd row 20 CAD, etc.  To convert CADs to US$ multiply the CAD value by 0.792367.  

For example - your console report might show:

CAD Increment Value = YY

   CAD             US$

    XX                   XX.XX
    XX                   XX.XX  (multiple rows follow)

Make sure your program uses good programming standards (headers, naming of variables, comments and other)

Once you write, debug and finalize the program: 

Sync it to GitHub.
Paste the following into your Canvas submission:
Link to the solution repository in GitHub
Also, from Visual Studio, copy your complete program code (all lines of code) and also paste them into the program submission
